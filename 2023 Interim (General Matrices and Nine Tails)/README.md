# Controversy
The duration of this interim test was reduced from three hours to two hours. It was claimed that the level of difficulty would be adjusted to reflect this change, but both sections were taken from separate three-hour-long past papers which were readily available on the Secret Revision Folder. An EdStem post was made, and here was the response from one of the lecturers who shall remain unnamed:

## EdStem response

I do not like commenting on exam design or solutions because we can spend all our time on politics rather than discussing tech.

Nonetheless, to contain panic spreading (given that we have a final with bigger impact on your marks coming up) I will clarify a few things.

**Use of heaps (untaught material)**

Section B Task 2 neither demands nor expects use of heap-like operations. There are simple implementations for both functions of Section B Task 2. I will leave it to you to figure this one out if you haven't already.

Indeed, an elegant solution and faster would use heap-like operations, but there was no limit on time complexity, so simple array manipulations would have done the work and will receive full marks if correct. I expect very few (<1% if any) to have come up with sub-linear solutions. 

**Length of exam**

Other lecturers used to allow for the same (Section B) questions 1.5 hours instead of 1. Having that said, that section was used a long time ago and we need to continue reassessing the level of our students. The interim test is a good way to do that as it has a small impact on your overall mark (maybe no impact if the entire test mark distribution is shifted to lower marks because we adjust the marks accordingly).

**Fairness**

Everyone was exposed to the same set of questions and given the same time to tackle them. 

**...the final**

Now the important bit which I believe is why some of you (given the number of likes in the post above, a lot of you) might be concerned. The final. The final (Section B at least) will contain the same level of hardness in the same time if on average the entire cohort did well on the interim. If I find that indeed the majority struggled, the design of the final (at least Section B) will reflect that. How will it reflect it? While I cannot give you the questions, you can expect me falling back to previous years' approaches which in essence is having the same level of difficulty you encountered in the interim but way more time.

I hope this helps. 

Also, can someone please share where are the readily available past tests? 

## Aftermath
Everybody received a +15 mark bonus for Section B.
